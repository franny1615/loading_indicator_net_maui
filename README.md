# Loading Indicator Sample

By using the MAUI Community Toolkit, styled a basic popup to show messaging.

StatusIndicator object can be used statically to show loading messages on any given page.
The popup will only ever show once, but messages can be updated on the fly, and will only need to be dismissed once.

The idea is to have a network status indicator app wide that is plug and play.
